# stock-analysis

## Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was threefold: 
1. To provide a project-based learning experience in developing in VBA.
2. To gain insight into how refactoring of code can improve the quality of the final product in several ways:
   -  **readability**: The ease with which other programmers can understand the code and its organization
   -  **efficiency**: Modifying the program flow to reduce or eliminate unnecessary or superfluous processing
   -  **reuse**: The benefits of reusing "code snippets" whan they have proven to be useful and "bug-free" in previous implementations. 
3. To demonstate by example one desired outcome of refactoring code - improving the speed of execution 

## Results: 

### Comparison of stock performance - 2017 and 2018

~~Using images and examples of your code~~

Even at a glance, it is clear that the market was kinder to green stocks in 2017 than in 2018. Only two stock (ENPH and RUN) had positive movement in 2018, while in 2017 all but one stock did so. It seems likely that influences on the  market as a whole heavily influenced this patter. Subsequent analysis should compare these stocks with other in defferent sectors to help peel apart the layers of the attributes that affect stock movement.

### Comparison of execution times - original  / refactored script

~~Using images and examples of your code~~

Execution times were significantly improved by the refactoring of the code. Times went from

## Summary: 
~~In a summary statement, address the following questions.~~

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
- Advantages: 
  1. Refactoring code is an efficient way to leverage "prior works" to allow subsequent authors to focus on **_improving_** the code and not simply reproducing previous work. 
  2. Refactoring code will, if done thoughtfully, provide a collaborative and community view of the approach and suggest patterns and practices that can be leveraged in other projects. 
- Disadvantages
  1. Starting from an existing working code base might discourage readers or consumers from independent consideration of a problem and approach and reduce the chance that disruptive and revolutionary rather than evolutions thought might be brought to bear. 
  2. Refactoring might encourage or promote the "misapplication" of an approach to other problems and result in awkward or misapplied strategies and principles. 
### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
