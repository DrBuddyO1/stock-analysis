# stock-analysis

## Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was threefold: 
1. To provide a project-based learning experience in developing in VBA.
2. To gain insight into how refactoring of code can improve the quality of the final product in several ways:
   -  readability: The ease with which other programmers can understand the code and its organization
   -  efficiency: Modifying the program flow to reduce or eliminate unnecessary or superfluous processing
   -  reuse: The benefits of reusing "code snippets" whan they have proven to be useful and "bug-free" in previous implementations. 
3. To witness directly one desired outcome of refactoring code - improving the speed of execution by writing more efficient code.
